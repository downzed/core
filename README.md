# core

a boilerplate repo for react and node applications.

### installation

this repo is meant to be cloned as the basis for a webapp or a group of webapps.

so just clone the repo and rename it, or copy the files to your own repo.

once you did that you need to install dependencies for both the client core and the core of the node servers.

```
cd servers && npm install
cd ../clients && npm install
```

installation of client side dependencies may take a while because it includes tools for compiling your code.
